So aesthetically it’s important to keep it in optimum condition.<br\/><br\/>If our barrier becomes compromised, then skin can become red, shiny, sore, constantly dry, uncomfortable or itchy. A compromised barrier can also irritate and flair up skin challenges such as psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis. <br\/><br\/>To keep the skin barrier healthy, it’s essential to support and comfort the skin by supporting the barrier function and feeding the barrier with lipid enriched skincare. <br\/><br\/>The Douglas Pereira Skin Health range has been formulated to support a healthy skin barrier by using our exclusive barrier repair complex and barrier repairing peptides throughout the product range.<br\/><\/p>"
